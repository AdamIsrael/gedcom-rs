# rust-gedcom

This is a work-in-progress library to parse a [GEDCOM 5.5.1](https://gedcom.io/specifications/ged551.pdf), which is the most commonly used file format for exchanging genealogical data.

In this attempt, I am continuing to learn Rust, and learning [nom](https://docs.rs/nom/latest/nom/), to parse a gedcom into a structured data source which can then be serialized, manipulated, searched, etc.
